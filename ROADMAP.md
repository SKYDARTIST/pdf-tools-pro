# Anti-Gravity: Neural Roadmap 🛰️🚀

This document tracks upcoming features, tool enhancements, and strategic updates for the Anti-Gravity ecosystem. Use this list to prioritize development phases after the initial Play Store launch.

## 🟢 Priority A: Core Tool Enhancements
- **[ ] Image-based Text Extraction (OCR)**
  - *Context*: From tester feedback. Enable Camera and Gallery access in the "Extract & Edit" tool to allow direct text extraction from photos.
  - *Tech*: Integrate Gemini Vision API via `aiService.ts`.

## 🟡 Priority B: Professional Workflow
- **[ ] Batch Processing Suite**
  - *Context*: Allow users to select multiple files for Merge, Watermark, or Redact operations in one go.
- **[ ] Legally-Binding Forms Bridge**
  - *Context*: Automatic field detection for signing government or medical forms.

## 🔵 Priority C: Intelligence Layer
- **[ ] Neural Search**
  - *Context*: On-device semantic search to find information across all local PDFs without opening them.
- **[ ] Voice-to-PDF Commands**
  - *Context*: "Hey Anti-Gravity, summarize this document for me" – hands-free accessibility.
