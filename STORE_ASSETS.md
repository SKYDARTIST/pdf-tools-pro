## Long Description (ASO Optimized)
The document revolution has arrived. Anti-Gravity is a premium, minimalist neural protocol designed for professionals who demand absolute privacy and intelligent document interpretation. 

Move beyond just viewing PDFs—start talking to them. Stop waiting for the cloud. Anti-Gravity delivers neural insights at the speed of your processor.

### KEY PROTOCOLS:

**1. NEURAL WORKSPACE (AI CHAT & OUTLINES)**
Engage in deep-context conversations with your documents. Ask questions, generate professional executive summaries, and extract high-fidelity outlines 100% offline.

**2. ZERO-PERSISTENCE MANDATE**
Your data is a sovereign asset. Anti-Gravity processes information ephemerally. No document remains on a server, and we never use your data for model training. Secure encryption is active by default.

**3. PRECISION TABLE EXTRACTION**
Transform complex PDF tables into structured, actionable data in one click. Our AI identifies row/column relationships with 99% accuracy for high-stakes financial and technical reviews.

**4. PRO-GRADE SCANNER**
Convert physical paper to high-fidelity PDF. Includes advanced "Neural Sharpening" to eliminate noise and enhance text clarity even in low-light conditions.

**5. THE LEAN CORE**
No ads. No bloat. No "nag" screens. Anti-Gravity is built for speed, maintaining a tiny footprint that won't lag your device. Instant launch, instant processing.

### WHY ANTI-GRAVITY?
Most "free" PDF tools are data-selling traps. Anti-Gravity is built on the philosophy of "Privacy First, Intelligence Second." It's not just an editor; it's a dedicated neural assistant for your digital library.
