# The Anti-Gravity Manifesto 🛰️

Based on an analysis of "Award-Winning" competitors (like Notewise), we have codified our core operational pillars to ensure we build an app that users actually trust.

## 1. Zero Data Hostages (Privacy First)
- **Competitor Failure**: Deleting user notes 14 days after a subscription expires.
- **Anti-Gravity Protocol**: We never store your data on our servers. Your PDFs and scans stay on your device. Even if you "quit" the app for 10 years, your files are yours. We cannot delete what we do not hold.

## 2. Transparent UX (Frictionless Export)
- **Competitor Failure**: Hiding the standard "Share"/Export button behind a paywall or forcing "Collaboration" logins.
- **Anti-Gravity Protocol**: A PDF tool's job is to let you share files. Our "Quick JPEG" and "Assemble PDF" buttons produce standard files immediately. No muscle-memory traps.

## 3. Atomic Reliability (Offline First)
- **Competitor Failure**: 5-hour sync times and data loss during updates.
- **Anti-Gravity Protocol**: Because we process locally (AI Polishing, Merging, Splitting), there is no "Sync" delay. If you have a signal or not, the tool works. Update safety is guaranteed by our ephemeral processing model.

## 4. Honest Feature Set
- **Competitor Failure**: Claiming an app is "Free" then paywalling the basic ability to import a PDF.
- **Anti-Gravity Protocol**: We remove tools that don't meet our "Pro" standard (like Compress or Protect) rather than shipping half-working or deceptive features. 

**This is why Anti-Gravity is the "Zero-G" choice for professionals.**
