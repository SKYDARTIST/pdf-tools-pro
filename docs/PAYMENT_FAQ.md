# 🛰️ Anti-Gravity AI: Payment & Lifetime Access FAQ

This document serves as the authoritative guide for the Anti-Gravity AI payment system.

## 🛸 THE BASICS

### What is Lifetime Access?
**Unlimited everything.** No expiration date, no recurring monthly or yearly charges. Pay once, use forever.

### How long does it take to get access after purchase?
**Instant in most cases.** Due to Google Play and server synchronization, it may occasionally take up to **5 minutes max**.

### Is my payment safe?
**100% Secure.** Google Play handles all transaction logic and encryption. Our servers never see or store your credit card or billing information.

## 🛠️ ACCESS & TROUBLESHOOTING

### I paid but didn't see access — what do I do?
Don't panic! Follow these "Recovery Path" steps:
1. **Restart the app:** Completely close and re-open Anti-Gravity.
2. **Check your connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet link.
3. **Wait 5 minutes:** Sometimes the Google Play "handshake" takes a moment.
4. **Manual Verify:** Use the "Support & Recovery" button on the Pricing page.

### Can I use my purchase on another device?
**Yes.** As long as you are logged into the same Google Play account, your Lifetime status will follow you across devices.

### What if I uninstall or reinstall the app?
Your access is tied to your account, not the installation. Just log back in with your Google account and your status will be restored automatically.
