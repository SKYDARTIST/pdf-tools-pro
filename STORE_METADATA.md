## 4. Production Readiness (Copy-Paste for Google Play Console)

### Q1: What changes did you make based on what you learned during your closed test? (294 chars)
Over 7 days, I resolved critical UI issues on Samsung/Narzo devices, added batch ZIP downloads for the Split tool, and redesigned the AI Assistant for better onboarding. Based on expert dev feedback, I also simplified the app's language to ensure the "Zero-Cloud" privacy model is clearly understood.

### Q2: How did you decide that your app is ready for production? (275 chars)
I decided the app is ready after trying to break it with very large files and seeing it stay stable. I personally fixed the UI bugs on Samsung and Narzo phones and checked everything twice. All the AI tools are now fast, simple to use, and totally private, just the way I wanted.
