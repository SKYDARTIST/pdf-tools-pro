# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 30, 2026

Welcome to **Anti-Gravity**. Your privacy is not just a feature; it is our foundational principle. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data with an uncompromising "Zero-Knowledge" and "Local-First" approach.

---

### 1. Data Collection & Usage
Unlike traditional document tools, Anti-Gravity processes your files **locally on your device**.

*   **Document Content:** We **NEVER** upload, store, or see the contents of your PDFs or images. All AI analysis is performed using local device processing or encrypted ephemeral API calls that do not retain data.
*   **Identity Data:** If you sign in with Google, we store your email address and basic profile info to synchronize your subscription status across devices.
*   **Technical Data:** We collect a unique Device ID (UUID) and anonymized operation counts (e.g., "3 merges performed") to enforce fair-use limits and improve app performance.

### 2. What We Do NOT Collect
*   We do **NOT** track your behavior or physical location.
*   We do **NOT** use third-party analytics or advertising trackers.
*   We do **NOT** sell or share your data with any third parties.

### 3. Data Storage & Security
*   **Supabase Storage:** Your account metadata is stored in Supabase with Enterprise-grade encryption at rest.
*   **Session Security:** Authentication tokens are stored locally in your device's secure storage and are purged immediately upon logout.
*   **Debug Logs:** If enabled, debug logs are stored locally and auto-expire after 24 hours.

### 4. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)
We fully support your right to data sovereignty:
*   **Download Data:** You can request a copy of your account metadata via Settings.
*   **Deletion:** You may delete your account and all associated data permanently through the "Data & Privacy" menu.
*   **Portability:** Your subscription status is tied to your Google Identity for easy transfer between devices.
